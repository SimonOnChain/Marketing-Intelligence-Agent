      "answer": "Last quarter, our revenue growth was significantly driven by a few standout product categories, as highlighted in the \"Revenue by Category\" bar chart. Leading the pack was **Health & Beauty**, generating an impressive BRL 1,258,681.34 with 8,836 orders and a strong average ticket of BRL 130.16. Close behind, **Watches & Gifts** contributed BRL 1,205,005.68 in revenue from 5,624 orders, boasting the highest average ticket at BRL 201.14, indicating strong customer willingness to spend in this category. Other notable performers include **Bed, Bath & Table** with BRL 1,036,988.68 across 9,417 orders (the highest order volume) and **Sports & Leisure** with BRL 988,048.97 from 7,720 orders. **Computers & Accessories** also made a solid contribution with BRL 911,954.32 in revenue.\n\nThese top categories demonstrate a mix of high order volume and solid average ticket prices, reflecting both broad appeal and profitability. Categories like **Watches & Gifts** and **Cool Stuff** (BRL 635,290.85, avg. ticket BRL 167.36) stand out for their premium pricing potential, while **Bed, Bath & Table** excels in driving consistent sales volume.\n\n**Recommendation:** Capitalize on the momentum of **Health & Beauty** and **Watches & Gifts** by increasing marketing investments in these high-revenue, high-value categories. Consider targeted campaigns or promotions to further boost order volume in **Health & Beauty** and premium upsell opportunities in **Watches & Gifts** to maximize average ticket size. Additionally, analyze the high order volume of **Bed, Bath & Table** to identify cross-selling opportunities with other home-related categories like **Furniture & Decor** or **Housewares**, which currently lag in revenue. This strategic focus can help sustain and accelerate revenue growth in the upcoming quarter.",
